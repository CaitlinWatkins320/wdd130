                <h1>I have 5 minutes to do my makeup. What can I do that would 
                    make the most difference?</h1>
                <p>If you only have 5 minutes to do makeup, concentrate on one area. 
                    Lipstick can change the face dramatically, or add more mascara to 
                    darken the eyes.</p>
                <h2>My foundation always looks cakey. What am I doing wrong?</h2>
                <p>Probably putting too much on and not blending it enough. Also, you always need to use a good moisturizer before applying foundation. A good moisturizer is key to properly hydrate and smooth the skin. I would recommend REN Evercalm Global Protection Day Cream. It makes your skin baby soft and creates the perfect canvas, whether you’re applying a foundation or CC cream.</p>
                <h3>What are the 5 beauty products every woman should have?</h3>
                <p>Cleanser, moisturizer, mascara, tinted moisturizer with SPF and a lipstick and you’re set to go!</p>
                <h4>How important is a great skin care routine to how good your makeup looks? Any skin care tips or product recommendations? </h4>
                <p>Skin care is massively important. You need a clean base to for the makeup. A quick 3-in-1 easy makeup remover that will also tone skin is REN 3-in-1 Cleansing Water. If the basics aren’t right, the rest won’t look its best! My top tip is always blend: Step back from the mirror one foot and take a look at all angles to make sure your makeup is well blended.</p>
