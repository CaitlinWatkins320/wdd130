    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>        Whitewater rafting can be traced back to 1811 when the first recorded
        attempt to navigate the Snake River in Wyoming was planned. With no
        training, experience, or proper equipment, the river was found to be too
        difficult and dangerous. Our purpose is to make sure we have all the
        equipment and material that will keep all of our guest safe. If you book
        a trip with us, we promise you that you will make memories that you will
        never forget. More than 60 percent of Americans are afraid of deep water
        and more than 45 percent are afraid of water over their heads. If this
        is you then you have nothing to worry about! By the end of our journey
        together, you will come out a new person; not scared of anything! We
        have amazing staff members who are on board for your safety and your
        entertainment. We only hire the friendliest and who follow our safety
        rules exactly! We really hope that you are convinced with our purpose
        and will purchase your spot now! Hurry and do so before out spots get
        filled up for the whole season! We are super excited to meet you and
        can’t wait to see your wonderful face!</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p> For our business, we target mostly collage students. Collage students
        are more likely to pay money to do this risky challenge. We also target
        the ones who are tired of living in fear and what to spice up their life
        a little. Those who aren’t getting enough adventure will feel the need
        to do something to shake it so as a business in Whitewater Rafting, we
        step up to take over so that they know its alright and they don’t have
        to do anything they would regret. In the past we have cured their fear
        and they come back, excited as ever just to get some more and we want
        all of our guest to feel like those individuals and we want them to keep
        coming back. To all the people wanting adventure, they will access this
        site by either laptop and / or mobile phone. We are anxious to see all
        the groups and ages who want adventure and we will keep a chart to post
        after every season to see who all wants that memorable adventure. If you
        are not convinced that this is you, look at the before and after photos
        of some of our guest (which we got their consent to post their photos on
        her).</p>
